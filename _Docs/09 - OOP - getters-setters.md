# Getters and setters

In Kotlin getters and setters are implicit. All access to properties is done using autogenerated getters and setters.

## Overriding getter and setters

To override getters and setters, properties must declared in the object, followed immediately by the getter and the setter

```
class A(prop1:String){
    var prop1 = prop1
    get() {
        return field
    }
    set(value){
        field = value
    }

}
```
``field`` is referred to the immediate preceding var declaration in the class and it can only be used in ``get`` or ``set`` functions.
